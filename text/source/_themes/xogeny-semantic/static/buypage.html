	<h3>HTML</h3>
	<p>
	  One of the main goals of this project was to make the book
	  widely accessible to anyone interested in learning Modelica
	  at no cost.  For that reason, the HTML version of the book
	  hosted by <a href="http://www.xogeny.com">Xogeny</a> is free
	  and will always remain so.
	</p>
	<p>
	  That being said, if you find the HTML version of the book
	  useful we encourage you to buy either an electronic or print
	  version of the book to show your appreciation.

	<h3>FAQs</h3>
	<dl>
	  <dt><b>Isn't this book free?</b></dt>
	  <dd>Yes, the HTML version is free.  But the other electronic
	  versions are not.</dd>
	  <dt><b>What do you mean by "pay what you can"?</b></dt>
	  <dd>
	    It means that I want people to learn Modelica in an
	    affordable way.  If you are a college student, you can
	    read the HTML version for free or spend $5 and get the
	    electronic versions of the book, too.  If you are a
	    professional engineer, I think you should be willing to
	    pay at least $20 for a book tied closely to your
	    professional activities.
	  </dd>
	  <dt>
	    <b>What happens if a newer version comes out?</b>
	  </dt>
	  <dd>
	    Anyone who buys the electronic version of the book is
	    entitled to free upgrades for life.  Be sure to include
	    your email address and you'll be added to the mailing list
	    of people who receive new download links for subsequent
	    version. So you don't have to worry about getting stuck
	    with an old version.
	  </dd>
	  <dt><b>What kind of DRM is there on the electronic version?</b></dt>
	  <dd>
	    <b>None.</b>  I hate DRM and I don't want to waste my time
	    trying to prevent people from stealing the material.  If
	    you are that desperate that you need to steal it rather
	    than pay $5 then go ahead.  But I believe that most
	    technical people are inherently honest and I trust them to
	    pay what they think is appropriate.  I hope they prove me
	    right.
	  </dd>
	  <dt><b>Wasn't this book already paid for via Kickstarter?</b></dt>
	  <dd>
	    The Kickstarter project was a way to demonstrate demand
	    for the book and avoid taking on a big financial risk.  At
	    the end of the day, the goal was a free HTML book on
	    Modelica and that was successful.  But I hope to keep the
	    book up to date and add future chapters on advanced
	    topics.  Those activities go beyond the scope of the
	    original Kickstarter project and by buying the book you
	    not only provide financial compensation for the effort
	    that was already made in creating the book but it
	    encourages such future work as well.

      <div class="ui column">
	<h1 class="ui header">Print Version</h1>
	<p>
	  At the moment, there is no print version of the book.  Our
	  goal is to incorporate all the feedback we receive on the
	  HTML version of the book before making a print version.  We
	  want to avoid situations where the print version becomes
	  obsolete compared to the electronic versions.
	</p>
	<p>
	  We do plan to produce a print version.  So, please subscribe
	  to our <a href="http://eepurl.com/PAEKj">mailing list</a> to
	  be informed when the print version becomes available.
